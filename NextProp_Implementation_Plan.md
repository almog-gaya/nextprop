This section outlines the specialized workflow and automation for the Distressed Homeowners lead management pipeline. The system implements a strategic approach to engage, track, and convert distressed homeowner leads through multiple touchpoints using a combination of automated processes and human intervention.

### 8.2 Dashboard Requirements
The specialized dashboard for this pipeline will display:
- Count of contacts who have not yet received a ringless voicemail
- Count of contacts who have received the voicemail
- Number of leads in the Motivation Stage
- Number of closed deals
- Timing of send-outs, including quantities
- Forecast of when contact lists will be depleted
- Notification for when new contacts need to be uploaded

### 8.3 Feature Requirements
- **Voice Quality**: The most critical aspect is ensuring the voice sounds realistic, implemented using GPT-powered connections
- **Script Management**: 
  - Client provides the script (with recommendations from our team)
  - Final script decision rests with the client
- **Customization Options**:
  - The script is the primary customizable element
  - Fields like name and address can be dynamically included
- **Control Parameters**:
  - Timing and volume control of send-outs remain in the client's hands

### 8.4 Task Management System
The system will track and present:
- Unread messages
- Missed calls with no callback
- Overdue tasks
- Automated notification for contact list depletion
- Alerts when client involvement is required
- Notifications when new leads reach the Motivation stage

### 8.5 Pipeline Stages
The Distressed Homeowners pipeline consists of 14 defined stages:
1. **Voicemail Received** - Initial contact attempt via ringless voicemail
2. **Undeliverable** - Failed contact attempts
3. **Call Back** - Prospect has returned the call
4. **SMS Back** - Prospect has responded via text message
5. **Motivation** (Lead stage) - Prospect shows interest/motivation
6. **Second Engagement** - Follow-up contact established
7. **Contact Made** - Successful two-way communication established
8. **Meeting Scheduled** - Appointment set with prospect
9. **Follow Up** - Post-meeting follow-up activities
10. **Negotiation** - Active discussion of terms
11. **Contract Sent** - Agreement documents delivered
12. **DD (Contract Signed)** - Due diligence phase after contract execution
13. **Money in Escrow** - Funds secured in escrow
14. **Closed** - Transaction completed successfully

**Note**: Automation is currently implemented only for stages marked in bold in the original diagram.

### 8.6 Process Flow

#### Initial Process:
1. Client uploads the contact list (homeowner engagement)
2. System processes the contact list
3. Contacts enter the unique pipeline for this strategy
4. Special dashboard displays current status

#### Response Handling:
- **SMS Responses**: System distinguishes between types of responses
  - Some responses will be handled by the AI Bot
  - Specific text responses are routed to the client for manual handling
- **Call Responses**: 
  - System detects when someone calls back
  - Client can specify routing preferences (AI handling or human agent)
  - System handles scenarios like "No answer" or "Outside operation hours"
